@section Motivation

@c complex machines with heterogeneous cores/devices
The use of specialized hardware such as accelerators or coprocessors offers an
interesting approach to overcome the physical limits encountered by processor
architects. As a result, many machines are now equipped with one or several
accelerators (e.g. a GPU), in addition to the usual processor(s). While a lot of
efforts have been devoted to offload computation onto such accelerators, very
little attention as been paid to portability concerns on the one hand, and to the
possibility of having heterogeneous accelerators and processors to interact on the other hand.

StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous multicore
architectures, it not only offers a unified view of the computational resources
(i.e. CPUs and accelerators at the same time), but it also takes care to
efficiently map and execute tasks onto an heterogeneous machine while
transparently handling low-level issues in a portable fashion.

@c this leads to a complicated distributed memory design
@c which is not (easily) manageable by hand

@c added value/benefits of StarPU
@c   - portability
@c   - scheduling, perf. portability

@node StarPU in a Nutshell
@section StarPU in a Nutshell

From a programming point of view, StarPU is not a new language but a library
that executes tasks explicitly submitted by the application.  The data that a
task manipulate are automatically transferred onto the accelerator so that the
programmer does not have to take care of complex data movements.  StarPU also
takes particular care of scheduling those tasks efficiently and allows
scheduling experts to implement custom scheduling policies in a portable
fashion.

@c explain the notion of codelet and task (i.e. g(A, B)
@subsection Codelet and Tasks
One of StarPU primary data structure is the @b{codelet}. A codelet describes a
computational kernel that can possibly be implemented on multiple architectures
such as a CPU, a CUDA device or a Cell's SPU.

@c TODO insert illustration f : f_spu, f_cpu, ...

Another important data structure is the @b{task}. Executing a StarPU task
consists in applying a codelet on a data set, on one of the architecture on
which the codelet is implemented. In addition to the codelet that a task
implements, it also describes which data are accessed, and how they are
accessed during the computation (read and/or write).
StarPU tasks are asynchronous: submitting a task to StarPU is a non-blocking
operation. The task structure can also specify a @b{callback} function that is
called once StarPU has properly executed the task. It also contains optional
fields that the application may use to give hints to the scheduler (such as
priority levels).

A task may be identified by a unique 64-bit number which we refer as a @b{tag}. 
Task dependencies can be enforced either by the means of callback functions, or
by expressing dependencies between tags.

@c TODO insert illustration f(Ar, Brw, Cr) + ..

@c DSM
@subsection StarPU Data Management Library

Because StarPU schedules tasks at runtime, data transfers have to be
done automatically and ``just-in-time'' between processing units,
relieving the application programmer from explicit data transfers.
Moreover, to avoid unnecessary transfers, StarPU keeps data
where it was last needed, even if was modified there, and it
allows multiple copies of the same data to reside at the same time on
several processing units as long as it is not modified.

@c Installing StarPU
@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Installing StarPU
@chapter Installing StarPU

StarPU can be built and installed by the standard means of the GNU
autotools. The following chapter is intended to briefly remind how these tools
can be used to install StarPU.

@section Configuring StarPU

@subsection Generating Makefiles and configuration scripts

This step is not necessary when using the tarball releases of StarPU.  If you
are using the source code from the svn repository, you first need to generate
the configure scripts and the Makefiles.

@example
$ autoreconf -vfi
@end example

@subsection Configuring StarPU

@example
$ ./configure
@end example

Details about options that are useful to give to @code{./configure} are given in
@ref{Configuration options}.

@section Building and Installing StarPU

@subsection Building

@example
$ make
@end example

@subsection Sanity Checks

In order to make sure that StarPU is working properly on the system, it is also
possible to run a test suite.

@example
$ make check
@end example

@subsection Installing

In order to install StarPU at the location that was specified during
configuration:

@example
$ make install
@end example

@subsection pkg-config configuration

It is possible that compiling and linking an application against StarPU
requires to use specific flags or libraries (for instance @code{CUDA} or
@code{libspe2}). Therefore, it is possible to use the @code{pkg-config} tool.

If StarPU was not installed at some standard location, the path of StarPU's
library must be specified in the @code{PKG_CONFIG_PATH} environment variable so
that @code{pkg-config} can find it. So if StarPU was installed in
@code{$prefix_dir}:

@example
$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH = $PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$prefix_dir/lib/pkgconfig
@end example

The flags required to compiled or linked against StarPU are then
accessible with the following commands:

@example
$ pkg-config --cflags libstarpu  # options for the compiler
$ pkg-config --libs libstarpu    # options for the linker
@end example

@subsection @code{STARPU_NCPUS} -- Number of CPU workers
@table @asis

@item @emph{Description}:
Specify the maximum number of CPU workers. Note that StarPU will not allocate
more CPUs than there are physical CPUs, and that some CPUs are used to control
the accelerators.

@end table

@subsection @code{STARPU_NCUDA} -- Number of CUDA workers
@table @asis

@item @emph{Description}:
Specify the maximum number of CUDA devices that StarPU can use. In case there
@code{STARPU_NCUDA} is lower than the number of physical devices, it is
possible to select which CUDA devices should be used by the means of the
@code{STARPU_WORKERS_CUDAID} environment variable.

@end table

@subsection @code{STARPU_NGORDON} -- Number of SPU workers (Cell)
@table @asis

@item @emph{Description}:
Specify the maximum number of SPUs that StarPU can use.
@end table


@node STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID
@subsection @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID} -- Bind workers to specific CPUs
@table @asis

@item @emph{Description}:
Passing an array of integers (starting from 0) in @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID}
specifies on which logical CPU the different workers should be
bound. For instance, if @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID = "1 3 0 2"}, the first
worker will be bound to logical CPU #1, the second CPU worker will be bound to
logical CPU #3 and so on.  Note that the logical ordering of the CPUs is either
determined by the OS, or provided by the @code{hwloc}  library in case it is
available.

Note that the first workers correspond to the CUDA workers, then come the
OpenCL and the SPU, and finally the CPU workers. For example if
we have @code{STARPU_NCUDA=1}, @code{STARPU_NOPENCL=1}, @code{STARPU_NCPUS=2}
and @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID = "0 2 1 3"}, the CUDA device will be controlled
by logical CPU #0, the OpenCL device will be controlled by logical CPU #2, and
the logical CPUs #1 and #3 will be used by the CPU workers.

If the number of workers is larger than the array given in
@code{STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID}, the workers are bound to the logical CPUs in a
round-robin fashion: if @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID = "0 1"}, the first and the
third (resp. second and fourth) workers will be put on CPU #0 (resp. CPU #1).

@end table

@node STARPU_WORKERS_CUDAID
@subsection @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CUDAID} -- Select specific CUDA devices
@table @asis

@item @emph{Description}:
Similarly to the @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CPUID} environment variable, it is
possible to select which CUDA devices should be used by StarPU. On a machine
equipped with 4 GPUs, setting @code{STARPU_WORKERS_CUDAID = "1 3"} and
@code{STARPU_NCUDA=2} specifies that 2 CUDA workers should be created, and that
they should use CUDA devices #1 and #3 (the logical ordering of the devices is
the one reported by CUDA).

field is ignored if @code{STARPU_CUDA} does not appear in the @code{.where}
field, it must be non-null otherwise.

@item @code{opencl_func} (optional):
Is a function pointer to the OpenCL implementation of the codelet. Its
prototype must be:
@code{void opencl_func(starpu_data_interface_t *descr, void *arg);}.
This pointer is ignored if @code{OPENCL} does not appear in the

@item @code{gordon_func} (optional):
This is the index of the Cell SPU implementation within the Gordon library.
TODO

@item @code{nbuffers}:
Specifies the number of arguments taken by the codelet. These arguments are
managed by the DSM and are accessed from the @code{void *buffers[]}
array. The constant argument passed with the @code{.cl_arg} field of the
@code{starpu_task} structure is not counted in this number.  This value should
not be above @code{STARPU_NMAXBUFS}.

This is a pointer to the performance model associated to this codelet. This
optional field is ignored when null. TODO

@node struct starpu_task
@subsection @code{struct starpu_task} -- StarPU task structure
@table @asis
@item @emph{Description}:
The starpu_task structure describes a task that can be offloaded on the various
processing units managed by StarPU. It instantiates a codelet. It can either be
allocated dynamically with the @code{starpu_task_create} method, or declared
statically. In the latter case, the programmer has to zero the
@code{starpu_task} structure and to fill the different fields properly. The
indicated default values correspond to the configuration of a task allocated
with @code{starpu_task_create}.

@item @emph{Fields}:
@table @asis
@item @code{cl}:
Is a pointer to the corresponding @code{starpu_codelet} data structure. This
describes where the kernel should be executed, and supplies the appropriate
implementations. When set to @code{NULL}, no code is executed during the tasks,
such empty tasks can be useful for synchronization purposes. 

@item @code{buffers}:
TODO

@item @code{cl_arg} (optional) (default = NULL):
This pointer is passed to the codelet through the second argument
of the codelet implementation (e.g. @code{cpu_func} or @code{cuda_func}).
In the specific case of the Cell processor, see the @code{.cl_arg_size}
argument.

@item @code{cl_arg_size} (optional, Cell specific):
In the case of the Cell processor, the @code{.cl_arg} pointer is not directly
given to the SPU function. A buffer of size @code{cl_arg_size} is allocated on
the SPU. This buffer is then filled with the @code{cl_arg_size} bytes starting
at address @code{cl_arg}. In that case, the argument given to the SPU codelet
is therefore not the @code{.cl_arg} pointer, but the address of the buffer in
local store (LS) instead. This field is ignored for CPU, CUDA and OpenCL
codelets. 

@item @code{callback_func} (optional) (default = @code{NULL}):
This is a function pointer of prototype @code{void (*f)(void *)} which
specifies a possible callback. If that pointer is non-null, the callback
function is executed @emph{on the host} after the execution of the task. The
callback is passed the value contained in the @code{callback_arg} field. No
callback is executed if that field is null.

@item @code{callback_arg} (optional) (default = @code{NULL}):
This is the pointer passed to the callback function. This field is ignored if
the @code{callback_func} is null.

@item @code{use_tag} (optional) (default = 0):
If set, this flag indicates that the task should be associated with the tag
contained in the @code{tag_id} field. Tag allow the application to synchronize
with the task and to express task dependencies easily.

@item @code{tag_id}:
This fields contains the tag associated to the tag if the @code{use_tag} field
was set, it is ignored otherwise.

@item @code{synchronous}:
If this flag is set, the @code{starpu_task_submit} function is blocking and
returns only when the task has been executed (or if no worker is able to
process the task). Otherwise, @code{starpu_task_submit} returns immediately.

@item @code{priority} (optional) (default = @code{STARPU_DEFAULT_PRIO}):
This field indicates a level of priority for the task. This is an integer value
that must be selected between @code{STARPU_MIN_PRIO} (for the least important
tasks) and @code{STARPU_MAX_PRIO} (for the most important tasks) included.
Default priority is @code{STARPU_DEFAULT_PRIO}.  Scheduling strategies that
take priorities into account can use this parameter to take better scheduling
decisions, but the scheduling policy may also ignore it.

@item @code{execute_on_a_specific_worker} (default = 0):
If this flag is set, StarPU will bypass the scheduler and directly affect this
task to the worker specified by the @code{workerid} field.

@item @code{workerid} (optional):
If the @code{execute_on_a_specific_worker} field is set, this field indicates
which is the identifier of the worker that should process this task (as
returned by @code{starpu_worker_get_id}). This field is ignored if
@code{execute_on_a_specific_worker} field is set to 0.

@item @code{detach} (optional) (default = 1):
If this flag is set, it is not possible to synchronize with the task
by the means of @code{starpu_task_wait} later on. Internal data structures
are only guaranteed to be freed once @code{starpu_task_wait} is called if that
flag is not set.

@item @code{destroy} (optional) (default = 1):
If that flag is set, the task structure will automatically be freed, either
after the execution of the callback if the task is detached, or during
@code{starpu_task_wait} otherwise. If this flag is not set, dynamically
allocated data structures will not be freed until @code{starpu_task_destroy} is
called explicitly. Setting this flag for a statically allocated task structure
will result in undefined behaviour.

schedule this task with respect to such dependencies.
This function returns immediately if the @code{synchronous} field of the

the task otherwise. It is also possible to synchronize the application with
asynchronous tasks by the means of tags, using the @code{starpu_tag_wait}

It is possible to associate a task with a unique "tag" and to express

be arbitrary) and set the @code{use_tag} field to 1.

not be started until the task which wears the declared dependency tags are
complete.
@end table

@node starpu_tag_declare_deps
@subsection @code{starpu_tag_declare_deps} -- Declare the Dependencies of a Tag
@table @asis
@item @emph{Description}:
Specify the dependencies of the task identified by tag @code{id}. The first
argument specifies the tag which is configured, the second argument gives the
number of tag(s) on which @code{id} depends. The following arguments are the
tags which have to terminated to unlock the task.

This function must be called before the associated task is submitted to StarPU
with @code{starpu_task_submit}.

@item @emph{Remark}
Because of the variable arity of @code{starpu_tag_declare_deps}, note that the

@node Hello World
@section Hello World

In this section, we show how to implement a simple program that submits a task to StarPU.

@subsection Required Headers

The @code{starpu.h} header should be included in any code using StarPU.

@example 
@c @cartouche
#include <starpu.h>
@c @end cartouche
@end example


@subsection Defining a Codelet

@example
@c @cartouche
void cpu_func(void *buffers[], void *cl_arg)
@{
    float *array = cl_arg;

    printf("Hello world (array = @{%f, %f@} )\n", array[0], array[1]);
@}

starpu_codelet cl =
@{
    .where = STARPU_CPU,
    .cpu_func = cpu_func,
    .nbuffers = 0
@};
@c @end cartouche
@end example

A codelet is a structure that represents a computational kernel. Such a codelet
may contain an implementation of the same kernel on different architectures
(e.g. CUDA, Cell's SPU, x86, ...).

The ''@code{.nbuffers}'' field specifies the number of data buffers that are
manipulated by the codelet: here the codelet does not access or modify any data
that is controlled by our data management library. Note that the argument
passed to the codelet (the ''@code{.cl_arg}'' field of the @code{starpu_task}
structure) does not count as a buffer since it is not managed by our data
management library. 

@c TODO need a crossref to the proper description of "where" see bla for more ...
We create a codelet which may only be executed on the CPUs. The ''@code{.where}''
field is a bitmask that defines where the codelet may be executed. Here, the
@code{STARPU_CPU} value means that only CPUs can execute this codelet
(@pxref{Codelets and Tasks} for more details on that field).
When a CPU core executes a codelet, it calls the @code{.cpu_func} function,
which @emph{must} have the following prototype:

@code{void (*cpu_func)(void *buffers[], void *cl_arg)}

In this example, we can ignore the first argument of this function which gives a
description of the input and output buffers (e.g. the size and the location of
the matrices). The second argument is a pointer to a buffer passed as an
argument to the codelet by the means of the ''@code{.cl_arg}'' field of the
@code{starpu_task} structure.

@c TODO rewrite so that it is a little clearer ?
Be aware that this may be a pointer to a
@emph{copy} of the actual buffer, and not the pointer given by the programmer:
if the codelet modifies this buffer, there is no guarantee that the initial
buffer will be modified as well: this for instance implies that the buffer
cannot be used as a synchronization medium.

@subsection Submitting a Task

@example
@c @cartouche
void callback_func(void *callback_arg)
@{
    printf("Callback function (arg %x)\n", callback_arg);
@}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
    /* initialize StarPU */
    starpu_init(NULL);

    struct starpu_task *task = starpu_task_create();

    task->cl = &cl;
    
    float *array[2] = @{1.0f, -1.0f@};
    task->cl_arg = &array;
    task->cl_arg_size = 2*sizeof(float);

    task->callback_func = callback_func;
    task->callback_arg = 0x42;

    /* starpu_task_submit will be a blocking call */
    task->synchronous = 1;

    /* submit the task to StarPU */
    starpu_task_submit(task);

    /* terminate StarPU */
    starpu_shutdown();

    return 0;
@}
@c @end cartouche
@end example

Before submitting any tasks to StarPU, @code{starpu_init} must be called. The
@code{NULL} argument specifies that we use default configuration. Tasks cannot
be submitted after the termination of StarPU by a call to
@code{starpu_shutdown}.

In the example above, a task structure is allocated by a call to
@code{starpu_task_create}. This function only allocates and fills the
corresponding structure with the default settings (@pxref{starpu_task_create}),
but it does not submit the task to StarPU.

@c not really clear ;)
The ''@code{.cl}'' field is a pointer to the codelet which the task will
execute: in other words, the codelet structure describes which computational
kernel should be offloaded on the different architectures, and the task
structure is a wrapper containing a codelet and the piece of data on which the
codelet should operate.

The optional ''@code{.cl_arg}'' field is a pointer to a buffer (of size
@code{.cl_arg_size}) with some parameters for the kernel
described by the codelet. For instance, if a codelet implements a computational
kernel that multiplies its input vector by a constant, the constant could be
specified by the means of this buffer.

Once a task has been executed, an optional callback function can be called.
While the computational kernel could be offloaded on various architectures, the
callback function is always executed on a CPU. The ''@code{.callback_arg}''
pointer is passed as an argument of the callback. The prototype of a callback
function must be:
@example
void (*callback_function)(void *);
@end example

If the @code{.synchronous} field is non-null, task submission will be
synchronous: the @code{starpu_task_submit} function will not return until the
task was executed. Note that the @code{starpu_shutdown} method does not
guarantee that asynchronous tasks have been executed before it returns.

@node Scaling a Vector
@section Manipulating Data: Scaling a Vector

The previous example has shown how to submit tasks. In this section we show how
StarPU tasks can manipulate data.

Programmers can describe the data layout of their application so that StarPU is
responsible for enforcing data coherency and availability across the machine.
Instead of handling complex (and non-portable) mechanisms to perform data
movements, programmers only declare which piece of data is accessed and/or
modified by a task, and StarPU makes sure that when a computational kernel
starts somewhere (e.g. on a GPU), its data are available locally.

Before submitting those tasks, the programmer first needs to declare the
different pieces of data to StarPU using the @code{starpu_register_*_data}
functions. To ease the development of applications for StarPU, it is possible
to describe multiple types of data layout. A type of data layout is called an
@b{interface}. By default, there are different interfaces available in StarPU:
here we will consider the @b{vector interface}. 

The following lines show how to declare an array of @code{n} elements of type
@code{float} using the vector interface:
@example
float tab[n];

starpu_data_handle tab_handle;
starpu_vector_data_register(&tab_handle, 0, tab, n, sizeof(float));
@end example

The first argument, called the @b{data handle}, is an opaque pointer which
designates the array in StarPU. This is also the structure which is used to
describe which data is used by a task.
@c TODO: what is 0 ?
It is possible to construct a StarPU
task that multiplies this vector by a constant factor:
@example
float factor;
struct starpu_task *task = starpu_task_create();

task->cl = &cl;

task->buffers[0].handle = tab_handle;
task->buffers[0].mode = STARPU_RW;

task->cl_arg = &factor;
task->cl_arg_size = sizeof(float);
@end example

Since the factor is constant, it does not need a preliminary declaration, and
can just be passed through the @code{cl_arg} pointer like in the previous
example.  The vector parameter is described by its handle.
There are two fields in each element of the @code{buffers} array.
@code{.handle} is the handle of the data, and @code{.mode} specifies how the
kernel will access the data (@code{STARPU_R} for read-only, @code{STARPU_W} for
write-only and @code{STARPU_RW} for read and write access).

The definition of the codelet can be written as follows:

@example
void scal_func(void *buffers[], void *cl_arg)
@{
    unsigned i;
    float *factor = cl_arg;

    struct starpu_vector_interface_s *vector = buffers[0];

    /* length of the vector */
    unsigned n = vector->nx;
    /* local copy of the vector pointer */
    float *val = (float *)vector->ptr;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        val[i] *= *factor;
@}

starpu_codelet cl = @{

The second argument of the @code{scal_func} function contains a pointer to the
parameters of the codelet (given in @code{task->cl_arg}), so that we read the
constant factor from this pointer. The first argument is an array that gives
a description of every buffers passed in the @code{task->buffers}@ array. The
size of this array is given by the @code{.nbuffers} field of the codelet
structure. For the sake of generality, this array contains pointers to the
different interfaces describing each buffer.  In the case of the @b{vector
interface}, the location of the vector (resp. its length) is accessible in the
@code{ptr} (resp. @code{nx}) of this array. Since the vector is accessed in a
read-write fashion, any modification will automatically affect future accesses
to that vector made by other tasks.

Contrary to the previous examples, the task submitted in the example may not
only be executed by the CPUs, but also by a CUDA device.
