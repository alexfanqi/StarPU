Step 1 - Install FxT

Get the sources from the cvs repository
	cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/fkt co FxT

Configure and compile FxT:
	./bootstrap
	./configure --enable-sync-clock --prefix=$FXTDIR
	make
	make install 

Step 2 - Configure StarPU to use FxT

	./configure --with-fxt=/home/gonnet/hannibal/Libs/FxT/FxT/target/

Step 3 - Execute applications as usual

- If the application was properly terminated (ie. starpu_shutdown was called),
  there should be a file named "/tmp/prof_file_user_".

- Call tools/fxt_tool on that file
	./tools/fxt_tool -i /tmp/prof_file_user_yourlogin

- Some files should have been created in the current directory
	- paje.trace : A Gantt diagram of the execution
		$ vite paje.trace
	- dag.dot : A graphviz graph of the task dependencies (according to tags)
		$ dot -Tpdf dag.dot -o dag.pdf
